It's not cheating if you are still typing. 

Run Actual_Scanner_Bot.py to use it and make sure you change the values to fit your screen.

This works, but typeracer has an "anti-cheat" (basically asks you type a captcha entry within a certain amount of time), so it'll stop working after the first race, but its a good program for one-uping your friends on typeracer

On average I got 400 WPM by running this program
